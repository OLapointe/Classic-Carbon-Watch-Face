# Classic-Carbon-Watch-Face
This is a draft. Trying to learn how to develop Androids Watch Faces

Latest release : trygin to change the batery hand color from the mobile companion activity. I tried to add some code base from samples i found but it doesn't work. Seems the watch doesn't receive the parameter from the phone. I don't know what i miss !
